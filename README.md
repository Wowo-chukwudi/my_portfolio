## Overview

### The App

This app is an interactive version of my resume which shows my name, picture, about me, social links and skills.

The codebase is based on Flutter and dart which are used to build highly responsive applications



### Links

- APK file Link: [APK file](https://github.com/Wowo-chukwudi/product-preview)
- Appetize URL: [Appetize](https://wowo-chukwudi.github.io/product-preview/)

## My process

I came up with the design myself. The design shows a background image with an opacity of 0.5 and on it is a stack of widgets displaying my name and what I do, buttons to link to about me screens and social icon links.

### Built with

- Flutter
- Dart

### Challenges

- Making the landscape orientation responsive

### Continued development

I would have added more pages like portfoilo (aka My work), educational background, work experience and a separate contact me page.
